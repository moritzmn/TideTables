##Why should i use this package?
You should use this package for producing tide tables from past data.

##How do i use it?

Import your data set first and transform it to a readable form. See attached data 'observation' for an example data frame.
```{r}
library(TideTables)
observation[1:10, ]

sapply(observation,typeof)

```
You can now use your data as input for the function 'TideTable'. Setting the periods for analyzing and synthesizing and wait for the table to be produced.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mytidetable<-TideTable(dataInput = observation, asdate = observation$observation_date[1], astime ="00:00:00", aedate= "1991/05/01", aetime = "00:00:00", ssdate = "2010/01/01", sstime = "00:00:00", sedate = "2011/01/01", setime = "00:00:00")

```
